To use the code for this part, you need to train the model for relu-4h from the problem 3, pickle.dump() that model as ```model_relu_4h.pickle``` and load it for the solution.py in this directory to compute the approximate gradients.
The best model for problem 3 was 4 hidden layer MLP with ReLU activation.
